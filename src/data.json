This was done in Python and I began using the PySimpleGUI library for the GUI with the SQL interface handled by psycopg2. I then developed this into a web-app by using Streamlit. This was then built as a Docker image and deployed as a web-app using Kubernetes and Terraform. I also worked to implement continuous integration principles to this project.",
