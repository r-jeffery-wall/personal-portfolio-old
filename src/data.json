            "description": "At my current job I worked on a side project to build a graphical interface for our team to quickly make commonly used SQL queries to our database. This was done in Python and I began using the PySimpleGUI library for the GUI with the SQL interface handled by psycopg2. I then developed this into a web-app by using Streamlit. This was then built as a Docker image and deployed as a web-app using Kubernetes and Terraform. I also worked to implement continuous integration principles to this project.",

Although not a full-stack app this project taught me a lot about APIs, and Python's requests library. Publishing my project on GitHub meant that I had to make sure that the code could be configured to individual use cases and was well-documented.",

More recently I have also made a mismatched quote generator in native JavaScript as part of the Codecademy front-end course. By combining these two projects together I helped to refresh my React skills.",
